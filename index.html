                        <p> Tsunamis can be caused in very multiple ways, but the most sever and common is earthquake. When the Tectonic plates encounter radioactive within the earth interior, this causes the plates to move. When they move (In earthquake context), it is usually between a continental and oceanic crust. Due to the thin oceanic crust, it is pushed down and produces subduction underwater. Due to this crucial formation, movement is caused causing force to the water, furthermore, moving and creating waves above the surface. As these waves are produced, they travel both outwards and inwards towards land. As they travel inwards towards coastal land, they are approached to the shallow surface, causing the waves to slow down and increase in size. Essentially, there are many waves produces in an event of a Tsunami, cause multiple significant impact on land.

            <div class="question"> 

                How and why a tsunami causes damage on land?

            <div class="second-para"> 

                <div class="text-wrapper">
                        <h1>Explanation</h1> 

                        <p> To put it in simple terms, Tsunamis changes the environment critically where it is targeted. Tsunamis causes such damaging changes to land because of its size and force/speed. When tsunamis hit land, it uproots trees and natural habitats. Species are pushed and pulled by the force of the waves and are drowned/suffocated. OR in likely circumstances, are hit/forced against objects, such as, building, trees, rocks etc. Because if the force, tsunamis carry a lot of dangerous things washed from land. When they destroy homes, they are opened up to pollution or dangerous liquids that can harm animals and humans. Not only does this harm inland species but also marine life, intoxicating with toxic chemicals. As you know, our Marine and Terrestrial are crucial and we need every aspect of diversity in order to allow our environment to thrive, if our chain is broken (animals die off) this is significantly changing our environment and can, monst-likely, dsrupt our everyday life. Another dangerous impact that Tsunamis cause on our earth is Erosion. Tsunamis are strong waves that can move and change many environments, due to this, Tsunamis severly alter the coastal area landscape by transporting coastal vegetation, manmade structures, manmade materials, etc. that can signifcantly disrupt the coast. Some of these transportated materials coasts can't handle furthermore destroying our enviroment. Another impact is mass injuries and loss of life. Loss of lfie and mass injuries upon specifically humanscan be ultimatly dangerous, if many humans are killied or injured they will not be able to persue their jobs to provide for their local town/city, which this can lead to lack in goods and services because there will be no one to fullfill these jobs. It can disrupt the economy with loss of life and disrupt many life. If, for example, there is a mass loss  of lfie for wild life such as, pigs, cows, vegetables, fruits etc. This means that there will be a massive loss in needs such as food, wood, etc. Meaning that many people will have to rely on other sources and will create a big problem. This will be a long term effect as well because then there might be a extinction upon certain species in the local area. Another significant impact is the damage upon homes, infrastructure and facilities. In many scenarios of a tsunami, homes have been destroyed by the force of the large waves and the materials tsunamis carry. E.g Carrs or Trees being smashed up against houses and destroying homes. When this happens, home residents have no where to sleep, shower, eat food, make food, work etc. Creating multiple problems for that person.

                            <p>The detection of a Tsunami is quite complex but really simple to understand. As there are two equipment's used (Tsunami Metre: Ocean and Surface Boi: Surface) they both are beneficial to the detection in their own ways. The Tsunami metre detects any sudden pressure increase, records the sea level and any sudden movement (earthquake) in the surrounding area. The tsunametere also takes the size and estimated type of earthquake, it will send a distress signal to the local Surface Boi, when the Boi gathers the information/signal sent, it is then sent to the programmed satellite which the satellite then send the signal to its desired tsunami detection base. </p>

                            <p>Recently, in New Zealand we have been communicated that there was a possible tsunami heading to the north island. We were warned through Phone sirens and notifications. This siren was sent simultaneously to all those in the victim area of the tsunami. There is also other ways to ensure citizens are warned. In the USA, they use Sirens and Emergency systems to warn those to evacuate the area. This is very helpful as it warns a large group of people of the dangers and help them to understand the local disaster happening. </p>

                            <p>The first thing you should do is wait for any sudden movement/earthquake that has happened or happening. It is crucial that you find a steady place to hide under, like a table or door frame or bunker etc (drop, cover, hold). Once the movement stops, immediately reach a high place such as, mountains, roof of a house etc. You also would want to move as much inland as soon as possible. Make sure that you are not spending essential time gathering ‘valuable’ items or ‘recording’ or gathering food. Stay out of the Tsunami hazard zone until officials tell you or announce it is safe to return. This is a very crucial part in survival against a tsunammi attack as it may be life threatning or life damaging. </p>

                            <p>Well firstly, earthquakes are such remarkable events that can impact anything. If you are open to weak shelter, the earthquake could destroy this, and it will fall or break on you and you will die or suffer from severe damage. Hiding under a strong structure will help reduce the damage or prevent it from happening. Seeking inland or high shelter is because tsunamis can only reach inland to a certain extent. If you are past this extent, you can prevent/dodge it from impacting you. The reason you would want to seek high shelter is because tsunamis are only a certain height. If you are higher than the tsunami, then you will not be hit from it because you will be above it. However, this is a risky prevention because you cannot really determine the size of a tsunami due to it increasing over multiple waves/time period.  </p>

                        <p> To put it in simple terms, Tsunamis changes the environment critically where it is targeted. Tsunamis causes such damaging changes to land because of its size and force/speed. When tsunamis hit land, it uproots trees and natural habitats. Species are pushed and pulled by the force of the waves and are drowned/suffocated. OR in likely circumstances, are hit/forced against objects, such as, building, trees, rocks etc. Because if the force, tsunamis carry a lot of dangerous things washed from land. When they destroy homes, they are opened up to pollution or dangerous liquids that can harm animals and humans. Not only does this harm inland species but also marine life, intoxicating with toxic chemicals. As you know, our Marine and Terrestrial are crucial and we need every aspect of diversity in order to allow our environment to thrive, if our chain is broken (animals die off) this is significantly changing our environment and can, monst-likely, dsrupt our everyday life. Another dangerous impact that Tsunamis cause on our earth is Erosion. Tsunamis are strong waves that can move and change many environments, due to this, Tsunamis severly alter the coastal area landscape by transporting coastal vegetation, manmade structures, manmade materials, etc. that can signifcantly disrupt the coast. Some of these transportated materials coasts can't handle furthermore destroying our enviroment. Another impact is mass injuries and loss of life. Loss of lfie and mass injuries upon specifically humanscan be ultimatly dangerous, if many humans are killied or injured they will not be able to persue their jobs to provide for their local town/city, which this can lead to lack in goods and services because there will be no one to fullfill these jobs. It can disrupt the economy with loss of life and disrupt many life. If, for example, there is a mass loss  of lfie for wild life such as, pigs, cows, vegetables, fruits etc. This means that there will be a massive loss in needs such as food, wood, etc. Meaning that many people will have to rely on other sources and will create a big problem. This will be a long term effect as well because then there might be a extinction upon certain species in the local area. Another significant impact is the damage upon homes, infrastructure and facilities. In many scenarios of a tsunami, homes have been destroyed by the force of the large waves and the materials tsunamis carry. E.g Carrs or Trees being smashed up against houses and destroying homes. When this happens, home residents have no where to sleep, shower, eat food, make food, work etc. Creating multiple problems for that person.
