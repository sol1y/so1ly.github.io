                    <p> I have created many assignments in HTML, but unfortunatly I cannot show you due to it not being published. However, there is a assignment I have created for Social Studies. It is a website explaining Ada Lovelace (The mother of programming) and why she is a Mover and Shaker! This was a very easy and basic website but it was so fun to make. It took me about 3 days to created it with both html and css. Here is the website: <a href ="https://sol1y.github.io/">https://sol1y.github.io/</a></p>

                        <h1>How to edit this</h1>
                        <p>Editing this is completely easy! Firstly, you want to open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the folder where this website's files is. Then select the information.html file and scroll down untill you see the class Page-item-wrapper. This is the wrapper for this text. There will be multiple due to having multiple texts paragraphs. So  you will have to read through each class. Then you want to navigate to the text-wrapper untill you see h1 'How to edit this' h1. This is the title, underneath this will be the paragraph, this is this right here! So now you can edit this text to anything you want! Have fun!</p>

                        <h1>How to use Github</h1>
                        <p>Using Github is hard at first and can be very intimidating. Do not fret because this text will take you through how to use it! Firstly you want to visit github.com and sign into your account (Or create one). Now you are in! Github is a free to use programming tool which allows you to share, edit, team up and publish code with just you or other people! It is crucial to understand how to use Github and how everything runs, which is why I will try to explain it. There is a main live repository are which holds the latest published code. So for example, you publish a code you worked on, this code will go straight up to the live repository for others to access. Now there is a local repository. This is where YOUR code is held. Other contrubutors do not have access to your local repository, so it is just on YOUR computer/device. There is an action called fetching, this is where your computer fetches the live repository from the cloud and overides any local repository in your computer. So essentially it pulls down the most recent code that has been published from your team. Now there is commiting and pushing. These are two different things. Commiting is just holding it onto your computer and getting it ready for pushing, and pushing pushed this commited code upto the live repository and overrides the live repository with your code you published. There is so much more to Github, but this was just the basics! </p>
